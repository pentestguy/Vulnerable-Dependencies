# Vulnerable Dependencies

## Overview

This project is created in C# and is aimed at demonstrating and learning Software Composition Analysis (SCA). It includes two vulnerable dependencies:

1. **HtmlSanitizer**
   - **Version:** 8.0.718

2. **I18N**
   - **Version:** 2.1.14

## Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a cybersecurity practice focused on identifying and managing the software components (dependencies) used in a project. It involves analyzing the software composition of an application to detect and address security vulnerabilities, licensing risks, and other issues related to third-party dependencies.

## OWASP Dependency Check

OWASP Dependency-Check is an open-source SCA tool widely used for identifying and monitoring vulnerable dependencies in software projects. It integrates with various build tools and package managers to analyze dependencies and identify known security vulnerabilities.
